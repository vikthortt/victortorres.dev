      Hey! I’m Victor Torres 👋
    </p>
    <p class="font-body text-paragraph my-4">
      I’m a software developer based in Guadalajara, Mexico, passionate about building clean, scalable, and delightful web applications. I believe in sharing knowledge freely, making things people actually use, and writing code that other developers, including my future self, won’t hate you for six months later.
    </p>
    <p class="font-body text-paragraph my-4">
      This blog is where I publish my deep dives, side projects, and ideas worth sharing — mostly for future me, and hopefully useful for others too.
    </p>
    <p class="font-body text-paragraph my-4">
      I created this space to share what I learn while working with modern technologies as I grow into a more well-rounded full-stack developer. I’m not trying to be perfect — I’m trying to <i>document the journey</i>, stay curious, and maybe, just maybe, help a few devs along the way.
    </p>
    <p class="font-body text-paragraph my-4">
      This blog is my digital lab — part archive, part playground. If it helps someone else solve a problem, build a better app, or even just feel less alone in the learning curve, that’s a win.
    </p>
    <p class="font-body text-paragraph my-4">
      When I'm not coding, I'm probably studying something new, reading a book, watching anime or playing some video game.
    </p>
    <p class="font-body text-paragraph my-4">
      Thanks for being here ✌️
    </p>

    <p class="font-body text-paragraph my-4">
      - Victor
