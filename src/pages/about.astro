    Hey there, I'm Victor ðŸ‘‹.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    I'm a software developer based in Guadalajara, Mexico. My career has mainly revolved around crafting fluid
    user interactions and system responses for the web, primarily with Angular and, more recently, Vue.
    Alongside, I've ventured into backend development using NodeJS and Python.

    My Story
  </h2>
  <p class="mb-4">
    My journey in the software industry has been a continuous evolution, marked by curiosity.  From my early days
    tinkering with code and discovering the power of VBA macros for Word and Excel, I realized the transformative
    potential of technology. Participating in the local stage of the Mexican Informatics Olympiad during my final
    year in high school introduced me to the intriguing world of algorithms and C programming. This experience not
    only sharpened my problem-solving skills but also ignited a passion for diving deeper into the world of programming.
