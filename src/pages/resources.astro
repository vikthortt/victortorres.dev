    This is a list of Internet resources that I've found useful at some point. Most of them are related to software development, but there are also some that I use in my daily life.

    Frameworks and Libraries:
  </h3>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-paragraph">
    <li><a href="https://angular.io" class="text-primary hover:underline">Angular</a> - AngularJS was the first framework I used, and I loved how easy it was build interactive apps with its two-ways data binding. When Angular 2+ was launched, I adopted it immediately, migrating the few production applications we had to it. Sometimes, I still miss working with it.</li>
    <li><a href="https://vuejs.org" class="text-primary hover:underline">Vue.js</a> - This is my main stack now. I've been working with vue for close to 5 years now, and I'm still in love with it.</li>
    <li><a href="https://react.dev" class="text-primary hover:underline">React</a> - To be honest, I don't like it. But it is the most used framework and it is never a bad thing to have it in your toolkit</li>
    <li><a href="https://astro.build" class="text-primary hover:underline">Astro</a> - So far, my favorite static site generator. I like the simplicity you can build sites with it. Plus it allows you to use multiple frameworks in the same project.</li>
    <li><a href="https://tailwindcss.com" class="text-primary hover:underline">Tailwind CSS</a> - My go-to CSS framework. You need to get used to its philosophy first if you want to be productive, otherwise making a change of style is a headache. I'm still learning all the customization you can configure</li>
    <li><a href="https://vitejs.dev" class="text-primary hover:underline">Vite</a> - If you ever worked with webpack, you know why I love Vite.</li>
    <li><a href="https://vitest.dev" class="text-primary hover:underline">Vitest</a> - A Vite-native testing framework. I used to skip unit testing due to how slow was jest running my tests. With Vitest that is not an excuse anymore (most of the time)</li>
    <li><a href="https://nuxt.com" class="text-primary hover:underline">Nuxt</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://qwik.builder.io" class="text-primary hover:underline">Qwik</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://nextjs.org" class="text-primary hover:underline">Next.js</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://remix.run" class="text-primary hover:underline">Remix</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://rxjs.dev" class="text-primary hover:underline">RxJS</a></li>
